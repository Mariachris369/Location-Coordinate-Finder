# Location-Finder

Project Title : Location-Finder


Description : This app tracks and displays your real-time location while running in the foreground.

Features : 
   1) The app tracks the user's location only while the app is in use (foreground), using a ForegroundOnlyLocationService.
   2) The app requests ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission from the user to access location data.
   3) It checks if permissions are granted and handles requests for them if necessary.
   4) Location updates received from the ForegroundOnlyLocationService service are logged and displayed in the appâ€™s UI.
   5) The app provides a button to start or stop location updates (foregroundOnlyLocationButton), which dynamically changes text based on whether location updates are active.
